# Opendoor Engineering Problem

[Heroku Link]()

If I were to spend more time working on this problem, there are a few things that I would improve. I would work to improve the speed of filtering the list of properties. Also, I would write unit tests to guarantee that the api was behaving as expected, which is particularily useful if changing other implementation details. Lastly, I would add better error checking to make sure the query parameters aren't named incorrectly.
